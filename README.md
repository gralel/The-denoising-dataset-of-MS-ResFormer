TEM Denoising with MS-ResFormer
An end-to-end deep learning framework for Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) data denoising based on modified EQTransformer architecture.
Project Overview
Multi-Model Architecture: 8 different neural network models for TEM denoising

Advanced Attention Mechanisms: Global and local attention with time-aware bias

Multi-Scale Processing: Parallel convolutional branches with different kernel sizes

Residual Learning: Deep residual connections to prevent gradient vanishing

Sequence Modeling: Combined BiLSTM and Transformer for temporal dependencies

Comprehensive Evaluation: RMSE, RRMSE, and SNR metrics in both original and normalized spaces
